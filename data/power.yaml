    Power sources.

    For electrified railway vehicles, sometimes authors would like to specify the type of power supply system,
    thus the extra voltages and frequencies are included.

    The recommended way is to include all related badges in the vehicle's `badge` property.
    For example, for a diesel-electric locomotive that uses turbine and is powered by 25kv 50hz AC overhead wire
    and 750V DC third rail, the `badge` property should be something like this:
    ```
    badges: ["power/diesel", "power/turbine", "power/electric", "power/overhead_wire", "power/ac", "power/25000v", "power/50hz", "power/third_rail", "power/dc", "power/750v"]
    ```
